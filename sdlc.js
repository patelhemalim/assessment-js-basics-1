// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/
// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain
 



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which we have to look for specific requirements, their needs and get more specifice detailes about the project/product we are going to work on."

const design = "This is the third step, in which we translate requirements into software design and where we define high level solution."

const implementation = "This is the fourth step, where we translate high level design into code solution.This is a stage that involves the transformation of the software technical data package into one or more fabricated, integrated, and tested software configuration items that are ready for software acceptance testing."

const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, where we can verify and evalualte products or softwares and see if it's working as expected by matching requirement and also test end to end solution along with intergarated components. It also involves performance testing to make sure software can handle expected load."

const maintain = "This is the last stage when software needs to be maintained to keep up to date to maintain regulatory , technogoly or security compliance. Also changing business requirements and any bug fixes that comes after launch needs to be addressed."
